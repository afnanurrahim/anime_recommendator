## About
Welcome to our anime recommendation system! With over **11,000+** anime in our database, we use advanced algorithms to provide personalized recommendations based on user preferences. Our system utilizes both content-based and collaborative filtering approaches, and uses the **cosine similarity** metric to calculate similarity between anime or users.

Our anime recommendation system provides 2 ways for users to receive personalized suggestions:
1. <ins> Content-based filtering </ins>: Our system analyzes the genre and rating of a single anime that a user provides, and based on that information, suggests other anime that may be of interest to the user. This approach is best suited for users who have not yet established a history of anime preferences. One can also sort the suggestions based on relevance, popularity, score and date of airing.

2. <ins> Collaborative filtering </ins>: Users who have established preferences can provide a list of their favorite anime. Our algorithm then identifies the most similar user out of our database of **9000+** users, based on the list provided, and suggests other anime that they might enjoy. The higher the number of anime in the list, the better the recommendation.
